# Federalist Project

## Introduction

This is my first trial of HTML and CSS coding. The website is the property of the Federalist Project on Twitter.

I'm part of an european federalist movement and we needed a website + I was supposed to learn HTML and CSS so I coded it as a learning exercise.

## How did I process ?

While I was following HTML and CSS lessons on OpenClassroom, I was using all the concept I was learning to create a first version of the movement website.
The website has as purpose to inform people about european federalism and to redirect them towards several twitter accounts (one per european country or lander in 
the case of Germany).

## And now ?

Now I'll continue my work, improving the site as my skills are improving themselves, and add new languages !
